TweetTwoScreens
===============

Tweet Two Screens is a tweet visualizer that will requests tweets via a twitter API and show them on a second screen. Tweets are given a priority based on number of retweets. It also makes an effort to display images attached to tweets.

Users can moderate tweets and can blacklist or whitelist users.

This was my senior project at the University of Florida and was actually used by [Dance Marathon at the University of Florida](http://floridadm.org) during their event. It was my first foray into a php framework (Codeigniter). One of the biggest mistakes I made on this app is that all of the pages are rendered in php and then basically rerendered in javascript. This could have been better done as RESTful app but I was not experienced enough at the time to do that.

You can see a demo of the admin panel [here](http://apps.mattgerstman.com/TweetTwoScreens/monitor) and the visualizer [here](http://apps.mattgerstman.com/TweetTwoScreens/).
